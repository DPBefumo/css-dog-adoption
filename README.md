# Dog Adoption Site

## Project Goals

To build one page site for an animal shelter. This project will be my first experience with HTML and CSS to create a smooth, responsive page that mimics the following design:

## What I Learned

By completing this project I have gained familiarity with both Flexbox and Grid displays.  It allowed me the opportunity to use both to test the responsiveness and what would be the best way to build this page.  I went with Grid display to display the cards, the reason being, I felt for future additions to this project, it would keep it with the same layout even if only one dog is added.  Understanding responsiveness of a page was also a big plus to this project, it showed how important it is with CSS designs to make sure a page is responsive to keep it clean looking.
